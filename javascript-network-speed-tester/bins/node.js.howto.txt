1. Install Node.js
We will not go into much details here, just visit the official Node.js website and download a suitable installer/package

2. Install a HTTP server into Node.js
There are plenty of HTTP servers among the Node Packaged Modules and we choose LocalServer.
Type the following command into your system operating console (internet connection is required as the npm utility will download the server from the npm repository):
	npm install -g localserver

3. Run the LocalServer from within Node.js
Now, that we have a HTTP server installed, it's time to run it and host our AngularJS network speed testing application. Just type localserver in the console:
	localserver

4. Run a sample application
The AngularJS network testing package contains a sample directory located near the bins directory under the angularjs-network-speed-tester directory. 
Run the sample.default.html application by typing http://localhost:9000/sample/sample.default.html into the address bar.

Please checkout the official documentation for more details.
Enjoy!
